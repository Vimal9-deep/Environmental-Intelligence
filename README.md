# Environmental-Intelligence

A multi-module driven project that analyzes environment quality, human health indicators, life expectancy factors, and soil fertility for any region entered by the user.

This project is prototype model which is built to give a new innovation .I have implemented my ideas that how environmental things can affect the human life .
this is a single and unified sytem where user can get all information of their surrounding and locality.
It Connects environmental pollution + human lifecycle + affection on soil fertility of that region.

# Project Objective

To build an integrated environmental & health intelligence pipeline that:

Fetches real-time air pollution data using APIs

Analyzes biological health parameters of people in that region

Estimates life expectancy impact based on environment + health

Predicts soil fertility using ML models and nutrient composition

Helps understand overall environmental & biological sustainability of a region

# Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-Learn (ML models)

Matplotlib (visualizations)

Requests (API calls)

AQICN & OpenWeatherMap APIs

Dataset (some real and some synthetic type)
